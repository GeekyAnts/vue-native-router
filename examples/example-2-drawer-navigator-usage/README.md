## Vue Native Router example 2: `createDrawerNavigator` usage

This project contains a simple example of how to use `createDrawerNavigator` for drawer navigation in Vue Native. It acts as a reference for the Vue Native documentation on [navigation](https://vue-native.io/docs/vue-native-router.html).

This is an Expo based example, but you can use the code just as easily with pure React Native.

Make sure that `example-2-drawer-navigator-usage` is your current working directory before running these commands.
