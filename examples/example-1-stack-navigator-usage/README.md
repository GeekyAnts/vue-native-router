## Vue Native Router example 1: `createStackNavigator` usage

This project contains a simple example of how to use `createStackNavigator` for navigation in Vue Native. It acts as a reference for the Vue Native documentation on [navigation](https://vue-native.io/docs/vue-native-router.html).

This is an Expo based example, but you can use the code just as easily with pure React Native.

### Commands

Make sure that `example-1-stack-navigator-usage` is your current working directory before running these commands.

First, install dependencies using
```
$ yarn
```

Then, to start the project, use
```
$ yarn start
```
