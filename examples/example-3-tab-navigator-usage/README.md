## Vue Native Router example 3: `createBottomTabNavigator` and `createMaterialTopTabNavigator` usage

This project contains a simple example of how to use `createBottomTabNavigator` and `createMaterialTopTabNavigator` for tab navigation in Vue Native. It acts as a reference for the Vue Native documentation on [navigation](https://vue-native.io/docs/vue-native-router.html).

This is an Expo based example, but you can use the code just as easily with pure React Native.

### Commands

Make sure that `example-3-tab-navigator-usage` is your current working directory before running these commands.

First, install dependencies using
```
$ yarn
```

Then, to start the project, use
```
$ yarn start
```
